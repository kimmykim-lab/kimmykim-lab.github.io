      <h2>Social Information Behavior Model</h2>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Developed a conceptual model to examine how trust, anonymity, and moderation influence information sharing and verification in online communities. The project draws from Dervin’s Sense-Making Theory and Bourdieu’s Social Capital Theory to analyze behavior patterns and platform dynamics.</p>
      <p><strong>Tools & Topics:</strong> Conceptual Modeling · Sense-Making Theory · Social Capital Theory · Online Moderation · Digital Trust · Misinformation Studies · Lucidchart</p>
      <p><strong>Key Contributions:</strong> Created an interactive diagram using Lucidchart to visualize relationships among trust, anonymity, moderation, and misinformation. Evaluated policy and design implications for online platforms, including the trade-offs between anonymity and accountability. Suggested improvements in AI-based moderation and trust-enhancing mechanisms like user-driven verification systems and transparent policies.</p>

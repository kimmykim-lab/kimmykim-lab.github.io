      <h2>My Story (Why I chose this path)</h2>
      <p>I first studied Library and Information Science as an undergraduate in Korea, where I developed a strong interest in how knowledge and information can transform people’s lives. Over time, I became more drawn to the fields of data analysis, data visualization, data management, and educational technology. I realized that data is not just a record of numbers, but a tool for explaining human experiences and change.</p>
      <p>Through hands-on experiences working with libraries, community programs, and data-related projects, I saw how even small improvements driven by data could significantly increase participation and inclusion. More recently, I’ve also become interested in combining artificial intelligence with education—for example, developing AI-powered learning apps or analyzing learner behavior data to explore how technology can create more personalized and meaningful learning experiences.</p>

      <h2>My Values and Personality</h2>
      <p>I value inclusivity, curiosity, and collaboration. For me, research and technology matter most when they create spaces where people feel connected and welcomed. Whether I’m designing a database, building a dashboard, or supporting a storytime program, I make it a priority to listen closely to diverse voices and ensure they are reflected in the work I do.</p>
